    abstract = {We have investigated the sources of error in bond lengths and dissociation energies computed from ab initio effective potentials derived from Phillips–Kleinman type pseudo‐orbitals. We propose an alternate pseudo‐orbital, effective potential treatment with the primary objective of agreement with all‐electron molecular calculations. This new treatment forces the pseudo‐orbitals to match precisely the Hartree–Fock orbitals in the valence region and thereby eliminates the major cause of error in the earlier calculations. Effective core potentials derived from these revised pseudo‐orbitals were used to compute potential energy curves for the ground states of F2, Cl2, and LiCl and the results are compared with previous all‐electron and effective potential calculations. Our effective potentials yield dissociation energies and bond lengths which are in excellent agreement with the all‐electron values. Furthermore, in contrast to other procedures, our revised effective potentials result in an excellent description of the inner repulsive walls of the dissociation curves.},

title = {Non-singular atomic pseudopotentials for solid state applications},
journal = {Journal of Physics C: Solid State Physics},
abstract = {A method for obtaining non-singular pseudopotentials from self-consistent atomic calculations is presented. Outside the core region the nodeless radial pseudo-valence wavefunction is taken to be identical to the real wavefunction and inside it is represented by a smooth analytical function. Both the first and the second derivatives of the radial pseudo-wavefunction are matched to the ab initio result at a core radius which depends on angular momentum. The resulting non-local self-consistent core pseudopotential is energy independent over a wide energy range. It is smooth and non-singular and is suitable for solid state bandstructure methods which make use of plane wave basis set expansions. This approach is so simple that it can be mostly carried out analytically, in contrast to a recently proposed method in which a pseudopotential is obtained by modifying the atomic potential instead of the wavefunction.}
